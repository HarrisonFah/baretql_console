Dataset containing tables without schema for testing table search and join on multiple columns.
The data is taken from WikiTables (http://websail-fe.cs.northwestern.edu/TabEL/).
Each folder has three files, left.csv, right.csv, and groundtruth.csv
The left.csv contains a table in which two or more of the columns join two or more columns in the table in right.csv.
The groundtruth.csv file contains the two tables joined together.
